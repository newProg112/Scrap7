# Scrap7 (Working Title 🚕)

An Uber-style ride-hailing demo app built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Firebase, and Google Maps.

---

## 🚀 Year-End Demo Roadmap (v0.1)

Our goal is to deliver a **demo-ready version of the app by December 2025**.  
Here’s the sprint plan we’re following:

### ✅ Sprint 1: Maps & State
- Centralized trip status (requested → accepted → en route → in progress → completed)
- Show only the active leg (driver → pickup OR pickup → destination)
- Reliable route handling with error recovery

### 💬 Sprint 2: Chat
- Real-time messaging between rider and driver
- Chat lifecycle management with unread badge indicators

### ✨ Sprint 3: Demo Polish
- Polished trip summary with distance, time, fare breakdown, and share option
- Demo mode toggle with mock trips for testing without live accounts

### 📦 Sprint 4: Packaging & Release
- Demo build variant with clear “Demo” labeling
- Safe defaults and staging configuration for testing

🎯 **Target:** Happy-path demo flow working end-to-end by **December 31, 2025**.
